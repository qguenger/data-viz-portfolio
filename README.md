# About Me 🐩
Welcome to my data portfolio! My name is Quintessa Guengerich, and I an artist, ex-engineer, and aspiring data scientist. My favorite thing is merging all of those talents together in the form of data visualization! And my other favorite thing is my poodle. And she's not even a "good" dog, so you'd be right to guess I take pleasure in simple things. I digress.

# Goals & Aspirations 🎓
As I continue my data visualization journey, I am most focused on how to do the following:
- Distinguish *what* story a dataset contains
- *How* to tell the story
- and how to tell the story **better**.

Professionally, I want to apply these skills at a not-for-profit organization with a proven track record of fighting for civil liberties, rights, and justice, to build data-informed policy.
