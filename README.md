# About Me üê©
Welcome to my data portfolio! My name is Quintessa Guengerich, and I an artist, ex-engineer, and aspiring data scientist. My favorite thing is merging all of those talents together in the form of data visualization! And my other favorite thing is my poodle. And she's not even a "good" dog, so you'd be right to guess I take pleasure in simple things. I digress.

# Goals & Aspirations üéì
As I continue my data visualization journey, I am most focused on how to do the following:
- Distinguish *what* story a dataset contains
- *How* to tell the story
- and how to tell the story **better**.

Professionally, I want to apply these skills at a not-for-profit organization with a proven track record of fighting for civil liberties, rights, and justice, to build data-informed policy.

# Hate Crime in the United States: Dispelling Myths and Mobilizing Action
Hate and hate crime in the United States is not well-understood. This is for a few reasons. First, hate incidents are known to be under-reported, with the National Crime Victimization Survey estimating only 50-65% of hate crimes resulting in a report. Second, police precincts are not required by federal law to provide their hate crime data to the FBI. This means two bottlenecks exist in the most comprehensive data set -- the *type of person* who would report a hate crime, depending on *if the police precinct* provides their data to the FBI.

The resulting dataset is not representative of the truth about hate crime occurences in the United States.

This lack of information matters. Hate crimes have victims who need access to physical and mental health resources. Hate crimes also have perpetrators who need to be understood so that interventions and preventative measures can be instated. Our lack of data makes a true needs assessment for any given community impossible -- and worse, the data that does exist may result in allocating resources on a basis that is *not* needs-based.

In this project, I am going to walk you through the data as it currently exists to establish what we *do* know: what's not true. 

First, we will look at the United States as a whole, before narrowing in on different communities throughout the United States to build an understanding of just how different hate crime landscapes can look, and discuss what information might be missing.

Finally, we will discuss what better hate crime reporting might look like, and what preventative solutions might look like moving forward with and without a comprehensive understanding.

## Initial sketches
1. Chloropleth of Hate Crimes Per Capita by County: Hate Crime is not just in the Southern States [Look at Columbus and Akron Ohio]
2. Sankey diagram of hate crime perpetrators and victims nation-wide, and in Mount Vernon: Hate Crime is not a monolith and is circumstantial 
3. Tree plots of total hate crime counts and per capita hate crime counts: Hate Crime is not just against racial minorities, *but* the data that exists suggests that they are more susceptible

# The data
I am using census data, FBI hate crime data, and the National Crime Victimization Survey data.

# Method and medium
I plan to use python and shorthand to tell this story and write in VSCode and publish to Github.
